      <h1>Just a beginning...</h1>
      <h5 class="jfc">
        Although there has been a twofold growth in the sales of EVs, they still have a very small share in
        comparison to the total marketshare but the growing popularity, environmental awareness, marketing 
        can lead to the growth getting further accelarated. <br><br>

        We can see the most EVs sold were vehicles and other types appear miniscule in terms of sales. This can be due 
        to the LMV sector slowly and steadily becoming mainstream, especially with the advances of prominent names like 
        <span class="tesla">Tesla</span> <br><br>

        We can see that there is still a lot of innovation pending in this industy, by looking at the Battery operated (BEV) 
        and Plug-In Hybrid (PHEV) powertrains, we can see how there is a demand for EVs. Other types of EVs such as <span class="red">Trucks</span>, 
        <span class="something">Vans</span> and <span class="blue">Buses</span> are yet to evolve into the market. <br><br>

        Only developed countries have experienced the wave of EVs, but all the other countries are yet to feel the hit. As various
        countries start developing further and with advancement in EV production and technology, the affordability of an EV become better, 
        we could expect the market to widen up and EV taking a big chunk of the market share away, as fossil fuels are depleting and becoming
        more and more expensive every day
